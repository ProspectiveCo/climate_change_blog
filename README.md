# Climate Change Blog

Hello, this is the data and Jupyter notebook for
a blog post on climate change.

The post serves as a way to show [Perspective](perspective.finos.org/)
as a tool for storytelling.

The notebook contains sources for the data. Download that data to this
directory under the directories 'temperature', 'glaciers', and 'energy'.
